  ```

- After adding the line, reload the shell configuration file for the changes to take effect:

  For `~/.zshrc`:

  ```bash
  source ~/.zshrc
  ```

  For `~/.bashrc`:

  ```bash
  source ~/.bashrc
  ```

### python

- Install the Python plugin and Python 3.12.7 using asdf:

  ```bash
  asdf plugin add python
  asdf install python 3.12.7
  asdf global python 3.12.7
  ```

- Verify the installation:

  ```bash
  python --version
  ```

### poetry

- Poetry is a dependency and environment management tool for Python, designed to simplify the process of managing Python packages and virtual environments.

  ```bash
  curl -sSL https://install.python-poetry.org | python3 -
  ```

### Google Cloud CLI

- Install Google Cloud CLI running the following commands. Find more details in [gcloud CLI](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/docs/install)

  ```bash
  curl https://dl.google.com/dl/cloudsdk/channels/rapid/downloads/google-cloud-cli-darwin-arm.tar.gz -o GCLOUDCLI.tar.gz

  tar -xvf GCLOUDCLI.tar.gz

  ./google-cloud-sdk/install.sh
  ```

- To initialize the gcloud CLI, run gcloud init:

  ```

- Verify the installation:

  ```bash
  gcloud --version

### Automating VS Code Extensions Setup

- To ensure all team members use the same set of VS Code extensions, you can automate the generation of the .vscode/extensions.json file. This file contains recommendations for the extensions required for this project.

  Generate the extensions.json File
  Run the following command in the project directory:

  ```bash
  code --list-extensions | jq -R . | jq -s '{ "recommendations": . }' > .vscode/extensions.json
  ```

  This will create or overwrite the .vscode/extensions.json file with a list of currently installed extensions, formatted for VS Code's recommendations.

- Install VSCode Default Extensions programatically.

  ```bash
  cat .vscode/extensions.json | jq -r '.recommendations[]' | xargs -n 1 code --install-extension
  ```

## Setting Up the Project

1. Clone the Repository:

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ovo_gcp_cloud_function_boilerplate
   ```

1. Install Dependencies:

   ```bash

   ```

   or

   ```bash
   poetry run setup

   ```

## Running Pre-commit hooks

- This command executes all the pre-commit hooks defined in your .pre-commit-config.yaml file on all files in your repository, regardless of whether they have been modified or staged for commit. It ensures that your entire codebase adheres to the standards and checks specified by your pre-commit hooks.

  ```bash
  poetry run pre-commit run --all-files

  or

  poetry run pre-commit run --all-files --verbose
  ```

- Additional Command Options

  ```bash
  poetry run pre-commit run black --all-files

  poetry run pre-commit run pretty-format-json --all-files

  poetry run pre-commit run pretty-format-json --files config.json
